Problem statement
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters.

Palindrome
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequences of characters which read the same backwards and forwards.
Example:
If the input string happens to be, "malayalam" then as we see that this word can be read the same as forward and backwards, it is said to be a valid palindrome.

The expected output for this example will print, 'true'.
From that being said, you are required to return a boolean value from the function that has been asked to implement.

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^6
Where N is the length of the input string.

Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1 :
abcdcba
Sample Output 1 :
true 
Sample Input 2:
coding
Sample Output 2:
false

# Read input as sepcified in the question
st = input()
# Print output as specified in the question
rev = st[::-1]
if rev == st:
    print("true")
else:
    print("false")
