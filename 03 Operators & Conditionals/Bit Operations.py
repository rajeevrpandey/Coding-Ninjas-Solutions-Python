Problem statement
You are given two integers, a and b. Your task is to implement a program that performs the following operations using bitwise operators:

1. Calculate the bitwise left shift (<<) of a by 1 position to the left.  
2. Calculate the bitwise right shift (>>) of b by 1 position to the right.
3.Print the results of each operation.

a = 12  # Example value for 'a'
b = 7   # Example value for 'b'

# Bitwise left shift for 'a'
print(a<<1)

# Bitwise right shift for 'b'
print(b>>1)
