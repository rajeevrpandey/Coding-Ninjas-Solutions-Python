Problem statement
You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) and a number X. Find and return the number of triplets in the array/list which sum to X.

Note :
Given array/list can contain duplicate elements.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
1 <= t <= 50
0 <= N <= 10^2
0 <= X <= 10^9
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
1
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
12
Sample Output 1:
5
Sample Input 2:
2
7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
19
9
2 -5 8 -6 0 5 10 11 -3
10
Sample Output 2:
0
5


 Explanation for Input 2:
Since there doesn't exist any triplet with sum equal to 19 for the first query, we print 0.

For the second query, we have 5 triplets in total that sum up to 10. They are, (2, 8, 0), (2, 11, -3), (-5, 5, 10), (8, 5, -3) and (-6, 5, 11)
