Problem statement
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size N that contains only integers, 0 and 1. Write a function to sort this array/list. Think of a solution which scans the array/list only once and don't require use of an extra array/list.

Note:
You need to change in the given array/list itself. Hence, no need to return or print anything. 
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1:
1
7
0 1 1 0 1 0 1
Sample Output 1:
0 0 0 1 1 1 1
Sample Input 2:
