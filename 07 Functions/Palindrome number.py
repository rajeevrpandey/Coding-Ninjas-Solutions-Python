Problem statement
Check whether a given number ’n’ is a palindrome number.

Note :
Palindrome numbers are the numbers that don't change when reversed.
You don’t need to print anything. Just implement the given function.
Example:
Input: 'n' = 51415
Output: true
Explanation: On reversing, 51415 gives 51415.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1 :
1032
Sample Output 1 :
false
Explanation Of Sample Input 1:
1032, on being reversed, gives 2301, which is a totally different number.
Sample Input 2 :
121
Sample Output 2 :
true
Explanation Of Sample Input 2:
121, on being reversed, gives 121, which is the same.
Expected time complexity:
The expected time complexity is O(log(n)).
Constraints :
1 <= n <= 10^9
Time Limit: 1 sec
'''

n=int(input())  
# taking n as a input 
## write your code !!
def rev(n):
    reverse = 0
    while(n!=0):
        dig = n%10
        reverse = reverse*10 +dig
        n //= 10
    return reverse

print("true")if(n==rev(n) )else print("false")
