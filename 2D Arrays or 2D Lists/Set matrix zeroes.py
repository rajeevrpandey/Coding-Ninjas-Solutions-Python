Problem statement
Given an ‘N’ x ‘M’ integer matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's, and return the matrix. In particular, your task is to modify it in such a way that if a cell has a value 0 (matrix[i][j] == 0), then all the cells of the ith row and jth column should be changed to 0.

You must do it in place.

For Example:

If the given grid is this:
[7, 19, 3]
[4, 21, 0]

Then the modified grid will be:
[7, 19, 0]
[0, 0,  0]
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1 :
2
2 3
7 19 3
4 21 0
3 3
1 2 3
4 0 6
7 8 9
Sample Output 1 :
7 19 0
0 0 0
1 0 3
0 0 0
7 0 9
Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
For First Case - Similar to the example explained above. 

For Second Case - 
Only the cell (2,2) has zero. So all the elements of the second row and second column are changed to zeros.
Sample Input 2 :
2
4 2
1 0
2 7
3 0
4 8
3 3
0 2 3
1 0 3
1 2 0
Sample Output 2 :
0 0
2 0
0 0
4 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
