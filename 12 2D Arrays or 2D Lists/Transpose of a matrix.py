Problem statement
You are given a matrix ‘MAT’. Print and return the transpose of the matrix. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by changing rows to columns and columns to rows. In other words, transpose of a matrix A[][] is obtained by changing A[i][j] to A[j][i].

For example:
Let matrix be : 
1 2
3 4

Then transpose of the matrix will be: 
1 3
2 4

Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
